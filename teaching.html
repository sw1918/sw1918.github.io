<h2>Directed Research Groups (<a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/research/directed" class="light">DRG<a/>)</h2>

<h3>Analyzing and Supporting Twitter-Based Science Communication</h3>
<h4>Co-facilitated with Keri Mallari and overseen by <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/garyhs/" class="light">Gary Hsieh</a> and <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~reinecke//" class="light">Katharina Reinecke</a>.</h4>
<h4>Spring 2020 (*Upcoming).</h4>
</div>
<p> In this DRG, the primary tasks include identifying relevant HCI researchers on 
Twitter, using text classification to categorize Twitter users, and designing and prototyping
a system (and its underlying algorithms) to help understand the reach of science communication
on Twitter. We will also be reading relevant papers about science communication on social 
media, NLP, and network science.</p>

<h3>HCI, Journalism & Misinformation: Understanding how journalists process, analyze and make sense of data</h3>
<h4>Co-facilitated with Melinda McClure Haughey and overseen by <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/" class="light">Kate Starbird</a>.</h4>
<h4>Spring 2019</h4>
</div>
<p>Students of this DRG are guided in research activities aimed at understanding and aiding 
journalists' work when using social media data. These include interviewing local journalists,
analyzing data, reading current literature, and designing tools to help journalists
deal with the vast amount of data in today's social media landscape.</p>

<h3>HCDE 518: User-Centered Design</h3>
<h4>Instructed by <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/lecturers-affiliate-adjunct-research" class="light">Daniella Kim</a>.</h4>
<h4>Fall 2019</h4>
</div>
<p>Explores the user-centered design paradigm from a broad perspective, emphasizing how user research and prototype assessment
can be integrated into different phases of the design process. Students learn to think like a user-centered designer and carry 
out activities that are key to user-centered design.</p>
