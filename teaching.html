<p>In my role as an Assistant Teaching Professor, I primarily teach core courses related to HCI topics like design, social media, cognition, and ethics. In the 23-24 AY,
  I'm teaching INFO 103, INFO 356, INFO 360, and INFO 463. </p>

<p>If you're interested in learning more about these classes, I've provided my most recent (probably, unless I forgot to update them) syllabi!
  These may be useful for UW students taking these classes, instructors who are curious about how I've taught these topics, or people who
  want a curated reading list. 
</p>

<p>Please note though, as a reminder, <b>these are not current syllabi, and UW students shouldn't use them to make decisions about what
  courses to take!
</b> Most of these classes are taught by other instructors too, with their own styles, so please don't read too much into my own syllabi!</p>
