<h2>Science Communication</h2>
<p> I am currently working with Professors <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/garyhs/" class="light">Gary Hsieh</a> and <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~reinecke/" class="light">Katharina Reinecke</a> to better 
understand how scientists communicate their research findings to the public. The increasing 
number of social media venues like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Youtube, and blog platforms 
like Medium, have offered numerous opportunities for scientists to reach non-expert audiences. 
Through this project, I hope to better understand how today's researchers take advantage of 
these platforms, the challenges they face when communicating their research, and how those 
challenges might be addressed. </p>

<h2>Science News and Social Media</h2>
<p> Related to the above project, I am also interested in understanding how people react to
and engage with science nows on social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit. I hope to 
learn more about how different platform features affect users' interactions with science news,
such as sharing and commenting, and how those actions in turn affect what users take away from
the stories.</p>

<h2>Journalists and Social Media</h2>
<p> I am currently working with <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/" class="light">Professor Kate Starbird</a> to better understand how journalists
use social media for news sourcing and verification. Recent work has been done in developing
technological tools to help journalists collect, visualize, and verify social media data,
but it remains unclear how the strategies and user needs of different types of journalists 
(e.g. editors vs. reporters), topics (e.g. national politics vs. local news), and 
organizations (e.g. print newspaper vs. online publication) vary, and to what extent. I hope
to better understand the breadth of these needs, to better inform the design of tools and 
techniques for journalists engaged in this type of work.</p>
