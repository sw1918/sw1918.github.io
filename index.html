<h3>Science Communication</h3>
<img class = "center" src="flasks.jpg" alt="Flasks">
<p>I am currently working with Professors <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/garyhs/" class="light">Gary Hsieh</a> and <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~reinecke/" class="light">Katharina Reinecke</a> to better 
understand how scientists communicate their research findings to the public. The increasing 
number of social media venues like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Youtube, and blog platforms 
like Medium, have offered numerous opportunities for scientists to reach non-expert audiences. 
Through this project, I hope to better understand how today's researchers take advantage of 
these platforms, the challenges they face when communicating their research, and how those 
challenges might be addressed.</p>

<h4>Methods</h4>

<ul class = "norm">
  <li>Survey</li>
  <li>Semi-structured interviews</li>
  <li>Modified grounded theory</li>
</ul>

<h4>Submitted for publication</h4>

<h3>Science News and Social Media</h3>
<img class = "center" src="insta.jpg" alt="Phone depicting the Instagram logo.">
<p> Related to the above project, I am also interested in understanding how people react to
and engage with science nows on social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit. I hope to 
learn more about how different platform features affect users' interactions with science news,
such as sharing and commenting, and how those actions in turn affect what users take away from
the stories.</p>

<h4>Methods</h4>

<ul class = "norm">
  <li>Experimental design</li>
  <li>Semi-structured interviews</li>
  <li>Bayesian analysis</li>
</ul>

<h4>In progress</h4>
