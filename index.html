<p>Hi! I am an Assistant Teaching Professor at the University of Washington iSchool. 
  I study how researchers can better engage with the public online, how science is discussed on social media, and how to 
  communicate about controversial scientific topics. I mainly teach courses around design and social media. </p>

<p>
  I try to keep my <a href="pubs.html" class="light">publication list</a> up-to-date, with pdfs of all my full papers. 
</p>

<p><b>If you're a UW student</b> interested in doing an <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics/curriculum/experiential-learning/independent-study" class = "light">
  independent study</a>, a <a href ="https://ischool.uw.edu/capstone/students/informatics" class = "light">research capstone</a>,
  or you just want to get involved in research, send me an email! Make sure to include your CV, your research interests, and what you want to get out of the experience.</p>

  <p>In addition, you can check out my <a href = "https://pulse-lab-uw.github.io" class = "light">lab's website</a> (very much a work in progress).</p>
